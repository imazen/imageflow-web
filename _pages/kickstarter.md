### Our Goal

The problem that we are trying to fix is a huge one - it infiltrates every aspect of web browsing, and has insidious consequences for businesses and artists alike.  Resizing images shouldn't be so complicated, but to date we have yet to see open-source software that adequately addresses the issues of speed, photo quality and server security.  Imageflow will be the software that changes that.

### Who would benefit from imageflow?

The simple answer here is anyone who utilizes images on their website, particularly when image quality is emphasized.  Imagine your customers are trying to log on to your website to make a purchase, but their browser is bogged down with over-sized images and nothing will load fast enough.  Think of all the missed sale opportunities!  

This would seriously benefit artists as well.  For many artists, the internet is the medium through which they make the most sales.  But if the photo quality is jeopardized during resizing, it is going to be a lot harder to convince people to make the purchase.


### Why back our Kickstarter?

We need support in order to make this happen.  If we get enough money in pledges, we will be able to push forward with Imageflow and create a product that will significantly improve the internet and user experience.  If we reach $500,000, we'll even license Imageflow as GPL so that it can be bundled with WordPress for free, potentially fixing 25% of the internet!  In addition, there are some pretty stellar rewards for backing us now (see Reward Tiers below).  Everything is 40% off across the board, and there are some special deals (including unlimited lifetime licenses!) that will only be available during the Kickstarter period.
