**Imageflow is open-source software which scales, edits, and optimizes images.** It's similar to our existing software, [ImageResizer](https://imageresizing.net), but is faster, produces better results, and is not bound to the Windows API. Imageflow supports Linux, Mac, and Windows – and can be used from any programming language. 

Imageflow is the first solution to offer uncompromising security and visual quality - but it also **trounces competitors in benchmarks**. It lets millions of websites and applications fix the [weakest link in their server security](https://imagetragick.com/) and will enable new ventures that require **instant on-the-fly image processing**.

There are two components to Imageflow: imageflow-server and libimageflow.

Imageflow-server can be deployed to the cloud in just a few clicks, and can be used by editing URLs in your browser or by using the REST APIs. Imageflow-server sends the right number of pixels based on your device size, and can cut load time in half for responsive websites that haven't yet implemented responsive images. Reducing site load time is often the cheapest way to boost sales and SEO ranking.

There's also libimageflow which is *designed* for direct use from all FFI-capable languages, and which works on all major server platforms.

For larger deployments, you can fully offload all imaging operations to separate servers.

### How does this relate to ImageResizer? 

* Imageflow is ImageResizer's future. Without it, ImageResizer can't become cross-platform, run on .NET Core, or be deployed on Windows Server Core.
* The Kickstarter 18-month transitional support contract (for both ImageResizer and Imageflow) is the only way to get paid ImageResizer support.

Your support in backing Imageflow will make ImageResizer 5 a reality. And if you just can't wait, it's possible to use libimageflow from C# today, if you're willing to P/Invoke.

### What are the benefits of using Imageflow?

Our promise with Imageflow is to deliver speed, security and image quality.  Features include:

* libimageflow can be used directly over FFI by any mainstream language. The second component, imageflow-server, speaks HTTP – and any networked device can use it. A human can use it from their web browser by adding ?width=200to the image URL (or any of 30 other commands).
* libimageflow has ~10x the throughput of ImageMagick, yet puts security first. It is correct, fast, and has an evolvable JSON API. Imageflow doesn’t try to be ImageMagick; it supports only the core image operations and web-safe image formats needed by most applications and websites.
* imageflow-server offers a JSON API – You can POST a JSON operation list or graph along with multiple inputs and outputs, and the results are returned to you. libimageflow can accurately predict the cost for any operation, which permits ideal work redistribution and load balancing.
* Imageflow supports Linux, Mac, and Windows


### Why Back our Kickstarter?

* Licenses are **41%, 56%, and 85% off**. You'll pay up to **7 times more if you buy later**.
* For just $600 (instead of $2,900) you can sell a hosted version of imageflow-server. This ultimate redistribution and SaaS license is restricted to B Corps or small businesses that meet the revenue limits.
* If you're an [ImageResizer](https://imageresizing.net) user, the [Transitional Support Contract is the **only way to purchase paid support**](/resizer_support).
* It's the best (and cheapest) way to get 1-on-1 consultation and support. 
* It's the fastest way to remove the liability of ImageMagick from your infrastructure. Support and transition assistance is heavily discounted via the Kickstarter.


**Imageflow can't happen without your support**. We've invested 4 years and over $100,000 in solving the hardest problems specifically for Imageflow. We now face a long list of clearly defined tasks with known solutions, but need your help to complete Imageflow and bring it to to your platform and tools.

### Goals

It's crucial that we ensure a **sustainable model for security maintenance**, so Imageflow will remain copylefted until we reach a funding level that can guarantee long-term support for you, our customers. **Your help in promoting this Kickstarter is essential to its success**. 

* **$50,000** (expenses only) Proceeds will cover our hardware, software, and hosting expenses for the next year of development, and fund collaboration with some of the world's best compression and optimization experts. *At this funding level, Imazen covers all in-house labor costs* and Imageflow will be licensed as AGPLv3 with commercial options.
* **$125,000** - Support contracts for Imageflow will be made available on an ongoing basis, even after the Kickstarter ends. Official C# bindings & Core CLR support will also be guaranteed at this level.
* **$200,000** - We create official PHP bindings and integrate libimageflow with Wordpress. Imageflow becomes GPLv2 + GPLv3 dual licensed so it can be distributed with Wordpress. GPL licensing would make commercial SaaS licenses redundant.
* **$500,000** - We immediately relicense Imageflow as MIT/Apache 2 so **it can be redistributed with every platform, language, tool and CMS**. This level funds extended codec research and optimization, with potential 2x performance increases. *Apache 2 licensing would make all commercial licenses redundant*.
