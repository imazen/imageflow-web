<div style="margin-top: 4em"> ImageResizer is the best image server for ASP.NET. It can be dropped into existing apps and works alongside your CMS or existing platform to eliminate manual image tasks, enable fast and adaptive websites, and improve your sales by reducing page load time. </div> </p></div>

**This is currently the only way to buy support and maintenance for [ImageResizer](https://imageresizing.net).**

By switching to Imageflow, you can expect to see significant improvements in image quality and load speed, and substantially smaller file sizes. Our current jpeg compression performance in Imageflow is much better than ImageResizer, but following the beta release, we hope to start work on some very cutting-edge techniques in the jpeg encoder in order to get additional filesize reductions.    

Our support contract will facilitate this transition, while customizing its integration to your individual needs.
