### License Terms

* Everything is dual licensed under [AGPLv3](http://imageresizing.net/licenses/agpl) and our [commercial licenses](https://imageresizing.net/pricing).
* Site-wide/enterprise-wide licensing will be the default commercial licensing model, similar to [ImageResizer](https://imageresizing.net/pricing). 
* Pricing will be sliding-scale based on company size
* OEM and SaaS licenses will be available. 

We will work with both open-source and closed-source CMSes to give them custom licensing that is compatible with their existing license terms. This is far more possible than it sounds!

Unlike ImageResizer, we aren't offering an Apache-licensed core. We don't want to unnecessarily segment functionality because of a business model, and this lets us offer you the best algorithms by default.
