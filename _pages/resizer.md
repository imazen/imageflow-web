### [Continue to the Imageflow Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/njones/imageflow-respect-the-pixels-a-secure-alt-to-image).

**Imageflow is open-source software which scales, edits, and optimizes images.** It's similar to [ImageResizer](https://imageresizing.net), but faster and is not bound to the Windows API. Imageflow supports Linux, Mac, and Windows – and can be used from [any programming language](/images/imageflow-features.svg).


**Imageflow tackles image optimization – expect smaller images, faster website load times, and increased sales.** 

Imageflow-server will offer a REST Querystring API like ImageResizer, but will also include a REST JSON API so you can perform complex operations on an arbitrary number of images. **It will be easier to deploy, manage, and communicate with.**



**Imageflow is ImageResizer's future.** Without it, ImageResizer can't become cross-platform, run on .NET Core, or be deployed on Windows Server Core.

After we deliver Imageflow, we'll turn our attention to ImageResizer 5, which will become a thin compatibility layer over Imageflow. If you want Imageflow's benefits sooner, consider adopting Imageflow directly as it reaches a stable phase. 

**Your support in backing Imageflow will make ImageResizer 5 a reality. And if you just can't wait, it's possible to use libimageflow from C# *today* (if you're willing to P/Invoke).**



### Why Back our Kickstarter?


#### Save up to 85%

* Licenses are **41%, 56%, and 85% off**. You'll pay up to **7 times more if you buy later**.
* For just $600 (instead of $2,900) you can sell a hosted version of imageflow-server. This ultimate redistribution and SaaS license is restricted to B Corps or small businesses that meet the revenue limits.

#### Paid support is exclusive to Kickstarter

* The [Transitional Support Contract is the **only way to purchase paid support**](/resizer_support) for [ImageResizer](https://imageresizing.net).
* It's also the only way to buy 1-on-1 consultation and support for Imageflow.

#### Zero risk

If we don't hit our goal of $50k, your card will not be charged. You can change/remove your pledge at any time before June 27th. 


**Imageflow can't happen without your support**. We face a long list of clearly defined tasks with known solutions, but need your help to complete them. 



### Purchasing instructions

You must create an account on Kickstarter.com. You can select any tier at or below your pledge amount. You can add on pairs of non-commercial licenses by increasing your pledge in $25 increments.
