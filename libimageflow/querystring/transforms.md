title: Image Transform Commands
---

- `width` constrains the image width. `w` is an alias for `width`
- `height` constrains the image height. `h` is an alias for `height`
- `dpr` is a multiplier for `width`/`height` to make responsive image usage easier.
- `mode` determines how to handle aspect ratio differences.
  - `stretch` distorts the image to be exactly the given dimensions, if `scale=both`. If `scale=down` (the default), the image is only scaled if `width` and `height` are smaller than the image.
  - `pad` scales the image to fit within `width` and `height`, then pads 2 edges (`bgcolor`) to make it.
  - `crop` scales the image to fit above `width` and `height`, then minimally crops to meet aspect ratio.
  - `max` scales the image to fit within `width` and `height`
- `scale` controls whether images are upsampled or not.
  - `down` - Never upscale an image - return at original size instead
  - `both` - Downscale or upscale to meet size requirements. Image enlargement causes blurriness and should be avoided.
  - `canvas` - Add padding instead of upscaling to meet size requirements.
  - `up` - Never downscale, only upscale to meet requirements. Rarely used.
- `anchor` determines how the image is aligned when you use `mode=crop`, `mode=pad` or `scale=canvas`.
  The default is `middlecenter` \* values are `topleft`, `topcenter`, `topright`, `middleleft`, `middlecenter`, `middleright`,
  `bottomleft`, `bottomcenter`, and `bottomright`.
- `sflip` flips the source image in the `x`, `y`, or `xy` dimensions.
- `flip` flips the result image in the `x`, `y`, or `xy` dimensions.
- `srotate` rotates the source image `90`, `180`, or `270` degrees.
- `rotate` rotates the result image `90`, `180`, or `270` degrees.
- `crop=x1,y1,x2,y2` crops the source image to the given coordinates. If x2 or y2 are negative, they are relative to
  the bottom-right corner of the image. `crop=10,10,-10,-10` removes 10 pixels from the edge of the image.
- `cropxunits=100&cropyunits=100` makes the `crop` coordinates percentages of the image instead of pixels.
- `trim.threshold=80` specifies a threshold to use for trimming whitespace.
- `trim.percentpadding=0.5` specifies percentage of padding to restore after trimming.
- `bgcolor` must be in the form RGB, RGBA, RRGGBBAA, RRGGBB, or be a named color.
  `bgcolor` determines the color of padding added with `mode=pad` or `scale=canvas`.
- `ignoreicc=true` causes the source image's color profile to be ignored and treated as sRGB.
- `ignore_icc_errors=true` causes color profile errors to be ignored rather than causing the operation to fail.
