title: Decode Command
---

Typically, you only need to specify the `io_id` of the file you're decoding.

```json
{
  "decode": {
    "io_id": 0
  }
}
```

However, some decoders accept commands that can be used to speed up the process.

The following causes the JPEG decoder to spatially downscale - in linear light - while decoding.

The image may not be scaled to the exact size requested, but it will be closer.

```json
{
  "decode": {
    "io_id": 0,
    "commands": [
      {
        "jpeg_downscale_hints": {
          "width": 1600,
          "height": 1600,
          "scale_luma_spatially": true,
          "gamma_correct_for_srgb_during_spatial_luma_scaling": true
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also do this for WebP images, although there is no support for linear light scaling:

```json
{
  "decode": {
    "io_id": 0,
    "commands": [
      {
        "webp_decoder_hints": {
          "width": 1600,
          "height": 1600
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can force the color profile to be ignored.

```json
{
  "decode": {
    "io_id": 0,
    "commands": ["discard_color_profile"]
  }
}
```

Or just ignore color profile errors.

```json
{
  "decode": {
    "io_id": 0,
    "commands": ["ignore_color_profile_errors"]
  }
}
```
