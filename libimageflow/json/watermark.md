title: Watermark
---

- `io_id` (**required**) specifies which input image to use as a watermark.
- `gravity` determines how the image is placed within the `fit_box`.
  `{x: 0, y: 0}` represents top-left, `{x: 50, y: 50}` represents center,
  `{x:100, y:100}` represents bottom-right. _Default: `center`_
- `fit_mode` is one of `distort`, `within`, `fit`, `within_crop`, or `fit_crop`.
  Meanings are the same as for [constraint modes](constrain.md#constraint-modes). _Default: `within`_
- `fit_box` can be either `image_percentage` (a box represented by percentages of target image width/height) or
  `image_margins` (a box represented by pixels from the edge of the image). _Default `image_margins` 0_
- `min_canvas_width` sets a minimum canvas width below which the watermark will be hidden.
- `min_canvas_height` sets a minimum canvas height below which the watermark will be hidden.
- `opacity` (0..1) How opaque to draw the image. _Default 1.0_
- `hints` See [resampling hints](resampling_hints.md)

#### Example with fit_box: image_percentage

This will align the watermark to 10% from the bottom and right edges of the image,
scaling the watermark down if it takes more than 80% of the image space,
drawing it at 80% opacity and applying 15% sharpening. It will not display on images smaller than 50x50px in either dimension.

```json
{
  "watermark": {
    "io_id": 1,
    "gravity": {
      "percentage": {
        "x": 100,
        "y": 100
      }
    },
    "fit_mode": "within",
    "fit_box": {
      "image_percentage": {
        "x1": 10,
        "y1": 10,
        "x2": 90,
        "y2": 90
      }
    },
    "min_canvas_width": 50,
    "min_canvas_height": 50,
    "opacity": 0.8,
    "hints": {
      "sharpen_percent": 15
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example with fit_box: image_margins

This will stretch/distort the watermark to fill the image except for a 5px margin.

```json
{
  "watermark": {
    "io_id": 1,
    "gravity": { "center": null },
    "fit_mode": "distort",
    "fit_box": {
      "image_margins": {
        "left": 5,
        "top": 5,
        "right": 5,
        "bottom": 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```
