title: Encode Command
---

When encoding, you'll need the `io_id` of the file you're encoding to, and a encoding preset.

```json
{
  "encode": {
    "io_id": 1,
    "preset": "gif"
  }
}
```

### Jpeg (MozJpeg encoder)

- `quality: 0..100` controls the image quality. Consider 80 as a good starting point.
- `progressive: true` enables progressive jpeg encoding, which takes more CPU time.

```json
{
  "mozjpeg": {
    "quality": 90,
    "progressive": false
  }
}
```

### Gif

```json
"gif"
```

### Lossless PNG

```json
{
  "lodepng": {
    "maximum_deflate": false
  }
}
```

### Lossy PNG

- `quality: 0..100` specifies the target quality to aim for.
- `minimum_quality: 0.100` specifies the actual quality below which to switch to lossless PNG.
- `speed: 1..10` controls the speed/quality tradeoff for encoding.
- `maximum_deflate: true` gains 1-2% in file size reduction at the expense of a tenfold increase in CPU time.

```json
{
  "pngquant": {
    "quality": 90,
    "minimum_quality": 20,
    "speed": null,
    "maximum_deflate": null
  }
}
```

### WebP (Lossy)

- `quality: 0..100` determines the encoding quality. 80 is a good starting point.

```json
{
  "webplossy": {
    "quality": 80
  }
}
```

### WebP (Lossless)

```json
"webplossless"
```

## Deprecated Presets

```json
{
  "libjpegturbo": {
    "quality": 90,
    "progressive": false,
    "optimize_huffman_coding": true
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "libpng": {
    "depth": "png_24",
    "matte": {
      "srgb": {
        "hex": "9922FF"
      }
    },
    "zlib_compression": 7
  }
}
```
