title: Security
---

If you're getting things like source images, command strings or width/height values from untrusted sources,
it's important to place limits on image sizes to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

JSON jobs have a `security` key that can be filled out like this:

Note that `max_frame_size` also limits the maximum decode and encode size,
so you don't have to specify `max_decode_size` and `max_encode_size` unless they are smaller.

If you don't specify a default, a `max_frame_size` of 10,000x10,000 and 100 megapixels will be set for you.

```json
{
  "security": {
    "max_decode_size": {
      "w": 10000,
      "h": 10000,
      "megapixels": 50
    },
    "max_frame_size": {
      "w": 10000,
      "h": 10000,
      "megapixels": 100
    },
    "max_encode_size": {
      "w": 8000,
      "h": 8000,
      "megapixels": 20
    }
  }
}
```
