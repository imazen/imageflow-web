title: Constrain
---

- `w` The width constraint in pixels
- `h` The height constraint in pixels
- `mode` A [constraint mode](#constraint-modes)
- `gravity` determines how the image is anchored when cropped or padded.
  `{x: 0, y: 0}` represents top-left, `{x: 50, y: 50}` represents center,
  `{x:100, y:100}` represents bottom-right. _Default: `center`_
- `hints` See [resampling hints](#resampling-hints)
- `canvas_color` See [Color](#colors). The color of padding added to the image.

### Constraint Modes

- `distort` Distort the image to exactly the given dimensions.
  If only one dimension is specified, behaves like `fit`.
- `within`
  Ensure the result fits within the provided dimensions. No upscaling.
- `fit`
  Fit the image within the dimensions, upscaling if needed
- `larger_than`
  Ensure the image is larger than the given dimensions
- `within_crop`
  Crop to desired aspect ratio if image is larger than requested, then downscale. Ignores smaller images.
  If only one dimension is specified, behaves like `within`.
- `fit_crop`
  Crop to desired aspect ratio, then downscale or upscale to fit.
  If only one dimension is specified, behaves like `fit`.
- `aspect_crop`
  Crop to desired aspect ratio, no upscaling or downscaling. If only one dimension is specified, behaves like Fit.
- `within_pad`
  Pad to desired aspect ratio if image is larger than requested, then downscale. Ignores smaller images.
  If only one dimension is specified, behaves like `within`
- `fit_pad`
  Pad to desired aspect ratio, then downscale or upscale to fit
  If only one dimension is specified, behaves like `fit`.
